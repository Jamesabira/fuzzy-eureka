Project Title: AI-Driven Database Optimization
Description
This project utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize database performance and improve data management. By analyzing patterns in data usage, the AI can identify and prioritize frequently accessed data and suggest modifications to database structures to improve performance. The system can also monitor database activity in real-time and make adjustments as needed to ensure efficient operation.

AI Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher
TensorFlow
scikit-learn
pandas
NumPy
Database Requirements
A supported database management system, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL
A database with sample data to test the system
An API for connecting to the database (such as SQLAlchemy for Python)
